Sometimes this causes me to have a lot on my plate to solve, in which I get very focused on completing the problem.  This weakness turns into a great strength though in it allows me to stay open to new ideas and problems and in learning new things.\n\nTell me about a challenge or conflict you\u2019ve faced at work, and how you dealt with it.\n\nAt work, one challenge I experience was in a few key engineers leaving the company that", "doc_id": "2bcdf24e-c63a-4c4d-9f33-39a903c4450c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a8eaf40c97a9e3623fabe65eebb13efb68e2b3597dc4ddf4d4aea8798960e579", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3828, "end": 7986, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703", "2": "790512b6-a0d2-4285-9c30-a855f24f5dc1", "3": "290c2218-3aac-4cc4-ad49-cfba3065c1f0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "290c2218-3aac-4cc4-ad49-cfba3065c1f0": {"__data__": {"text": "work, one challenge I experience was in a few key engineers leaving the company that were on our project.  Due to losing key skills and knowledge, our team was unsure about the project\u2019s future.  I quickly took the challenge to learn as much as I could from them before they left and took over their team responsibilities.  This was a great path for me because I learned an unbelievable amount of things and new techniques from this endeavor.\n\nTell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills.\n\nOne of my most recent successes using my leadership skills was actually in a mentorship that I am a part of.  In mentoring an aspiring software engineer, I quickly recognized her ability to problem solve and breadth of knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Through listening and working with her, I was able to develop a strong case to my leadership to get her involved with our artificial intelligence program.  My leadership quickly agreed and now she is working with our team.\n\nWhat type of work environment do you prefer?\n\nI prefer a work environment that is diverse, inclusive, understanding, and willing to be eccentric, agile, and disruptive.\n\nWhat\u2019s your work style?\n\nMy work style includes the following.  I tend to get involved with several projects that interest me and allocate my time between each project throughout the day.  This ensures that whenever I am facing a challenging problem and need to step away from it to gain perspective; I can switch gears to something else, which often leads to having a \u2018House\u2019 moment on the solution to the original challenging problem.  I like to talk through problems and write out solutions.  I believe one must fully detail out a problem before ever writing any code.\n\nWhat\u2019s your management style?\n\nMy management style includes the following.  I believe that every single team member has a voice that should be heard and listened to.  I ensure that all team mates get there opportunity to express their opinion on the task to be done and get to work on what they are passionate about, even if they have not done it before.\n\nHow do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?\n\nIn high pressure or stressful situations, I tend to blossom.  These situations often give my brain a clear vision of how to accomplish the goal and appease the high stress and pressure.  I tend to break down whatever is causing the stressful situations into accomplishable tasks that I can then knock out.\n\nWhat do you like to do outside of work?\n\nOutside of work, I love to spend time with my family, from outdoor activities like swimming and bike riding, to reading books with my children, and to going out on the town with my wife.  I also truly enjoy listening to audiobooks, reading tech trends, playing video games and table-top games, and exercising.  Finally, I love building new things, whether that is technology focused or not.\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nBesides my family, I am extremely passionate about performing hard work.  I love to put the time in to create something incredible and work with an amazing team in collaboration towards a goal.  I am also very passionate about everyone having a voice that should be listened to.\n\nWhat motivates you?\n\nThis is what motivates me.  When I am reading the news, new technology blogs, or talking to co-workers and friends, and I learn of a new technology trend that is cutting edge.  This inspires me to learn about it and attempt to integrate it into my working career.  Additionally, teaching people motivates me.  I love sharing knowledge and learning from my peers.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in five years?\n\nIn five years, I am planning to have completed a PHD and running deep research into general artificial intelligence and applying it to technologies.\n\nWhat are you looking for in a new position and what\u2019s your dream job?\n\nMy dream job includes the following.

I would love the freedom to build new technologies, deploy them, and listen to customer feedback.  My dream job would be to work within a team that is ever-changing and growing, where we love to listen to each other\u2019s ideas and constructively build technologies together.\n\nWhat is your greatest strength and what makes you unique?\n\nMy greatest strength and uniqueness come from my tenacious drive to help get the job done and discover new techniques in the field.  I do not believe in unsolvable problems.  I am very savvy at breaking down these problems into accomplishable chunks and then spearheading those chunks to finish.  Whilst doing this, I ensure to flex my tasks based off new discoveries and better techniques.  This allows me to stay up to date with latest technology and to deliver a completed product quickly.\n\nWhat would your first few months look like in this role?\n\nMy first few months in this role would include the following.  My highest priority would be to contribute real-work to the business as soon as possible.  This would include me plugging myself into some needed development.  I believe that you get the most up to speed at a new job through actually doing real work.  I would survey existing tools and infrastructure needed to get my job done.  After accomplishing real work, I would survey the business areas of the company and build a strong rapport with my team and leadership and find areas I can contribute to immediately.\n\nHow many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?\n\nLet me tell you how many tennis balls to fit into a limousine.  Let\u2019s assume we have a standard 2 cab limousine, approximately the length of 2 cars.  Let\u2019s compare the limousine to a cylinder.  Next, let\u2019s partition the cylinder into circles approximately the depth of the length of 1 tennis ball.  Each circle can hold about a radius of 8 tennis balls.  You can then calculate the area of each circle slice and assume there are about 12 slices per car length.  This would make 180 times 24 tennis balls.  Add an additional 180 for odd spots in the car such as foot space.  3600 plus 740 plus 180 equal 4520 tennis balls.  That\u2019s a lot!\n\nIf you were an animal, which one would you want to be?\n\nIf I were an animal, I would be a flapjack jelly fish if I were an animal.  That way, I could reach the depths of the ocean to reveal some of the greatest mysteries left on this planet.\n\nSell me this pen.\n\nLet me sell you this pen.  Behold your eyes upon this great artifact in front of me.  You may think this is just an ordinary pen, but it turns out, you are quite lucky today.  When you take this pen from my hand and draw with it.  An Artificial Intelligence inscribed in this pen will watch as you draw, guiding you as you draw, to reveal an incredible work of art before you.  This pen and living power can be yours.", "doc_id": "5da76ab8-1647-4ce1-a052-92caffdd1c0d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b410156624cdbbb0f025c2c041d81ac8fdb320fcff72f00adbdeb69fd64704dd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 12143, "end": 15041, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703", "2": "290c2218-3aac-4cc4-ad49-cfba3065c1f0"}}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703": {"doc_ids": ["790512b6-a0d2-4285-9c30-a855f24f5dc1", "2bcdf24e-c63a-4c4d-9f33-39a903c4450c", "290c2218-3aac-4cc4-ad49-cfba3065c1f0", "5da76ab8-1647-4ce1-a052-92caffdd1c0d"], "extra_info": {}}}, "docstore/metadata": {"790512b6-a0d2-4285-9c30-a855f24f5dc1": {"doc_hash": "ba4b58e252aad6c93a6a1fa131afc2224890e4f994c954a0312fd12da4120448", "ref_doc_id": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703"}, "2bcdf24e-c63a-4c4d-9f33-39a903c4450c": {"doc_hash": "a8eaf40c97a9e3623fabe65eebb13efb68e2b3597dc4ddf4d4aea8798960e579", "ref_doc_id": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703"}, "290c2218-3aac-4cc4-ad49-cfba3065c1f0": {"doc_hash": "933b63c66a1e4a2e1c81a645048fe6b71cf04a506b8c50e27cc6c55aeec6069d", "ref_doc_id": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703"}, "5da76ab8-1647-4ce1-a052-92caffdd1c0d": {"doc_hash": "b410156624cdbbb0f025c2c041d81ac8fdb320fcff72f00adbdeb69fd64704dd", "ref_doc_id": "52c73b2f-eb3e-4b98-8196-592199b95703"}}}
